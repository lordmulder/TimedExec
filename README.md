Introduction
============

**TimedExec** is a small utility for *benchmarking* command-line programs. It will *execute* the specified program with the specified command-line arguments and then *measure* the time that it takes for the execution to complete. In order to obtain *accurate* results, all measurements are implemented via *high-resolution* performance timers. And, since program execution times unavoidably are subject to certain variations (e.g. due to environmental noise), each test will be repeated *multiple* times. The number of metering passes can be configured as desired. Optionally, a number of "warm-up" passes can be performed *prior to* the first metering pass. The warm-up passes prevent caching effects from interfering with the execution times.

TimedExec will then compute the ***mean*** execution time as well as the ***median*** execution time of all metering passes. It will also record the *fastest* and *slowest* execution time that has been measured. Furthermore, TimedExec computes the *standard error* in order to determine [***confidence intervals***](http://www.uni-siegen.de/phil/sozialwissenschaften/soziologie/mitarbeiter/ludwig-mayerhofer/statistik/statistik_downloads/konfidenzintervalle.pdf) from the benchmarking results. These are the *ranges* which contain the program's “real” average execution time (expected value), *with very high probability*. All results will be saved to a log file.


Usage Instructions
==================

*TimedExec* uses a very simple command-line syntax. Just type **`TimedExec`**, followed by the program that you want to benchmark. Optionally, any number arguments can be appended; these parameters will be passed to the program.

***Note:*** Some options that influence the behavior of TimedExec can be controlled via environment variables.

Usage:
  TimedExec.exe <Program.exe> [Arguments]

Influential environment variables:
  TIMED_EXEC_PASSES        - Number of execution passes (default: 5)
  TIMED_EXEC_WARMUP_PASSES - Number of warm-up passes (default: 1)
  TIMED_EXEC_LOGFILE       - Log-File Name (default: "TimedExec.log")
  TIMED_EXEC_NO_CHECKS     - Set this to *disable* exit code checks
  TIMED_EXEC_CLOCK_TYPE    - The type of clock used for measurements
```

Clock Types
-----------

*TimedExec* supports the following clock types:

- `WALLCLOCK` &ndash; the wall-clock time, also known as *elapsed real time* (default)
- `CPU_TOTAL` &ndash; total CPU time, i.e. sum of CPU time spent in "user" *and* "kernel" modes
- `CPU_USER` &ndash; CPU time spent in "user" mode only
- `CPU_KERNEL` &ndash; CPU time spent in "kernel" mode only

Usage Example
-------------

In the following example we use *TimedExec* to benchmark the program **`ping.exe`** with the arguments **`-n 12 www.google.com`**. By default, the command will be executed *five* times, preceded by a single "warm-up" pass:

```
TimedExec.exe C:\Windows\System32\ping.exe -n 12 www.google.com
```


Results
=======

The resulting output, after all metering passes have been completed, looks like this:

```
===============================================================================
TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY AFTER 5 METERING PASSES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mean Execution Time     : 24.687 seconds
Median Execution Time   : 20.522 seconds
90% Confidence Interval : +/- 6.330 (25.643%) = [18.357, 31.018] seconds
95% Confidence Interval : +/- 7.543 (30.553%) = [17.144, 32.230] seconds
99% Confidence Interval : +/- 9.913 (40.156%) = [14.774, 34.600] seconds
Standard Deviation      : 7.697 seconds
Standard Error          : 3.848 seconds
Fastest / Slowest Pass  : 19.739 / 37.916 seconds
Active Clock Type       : WALLCLOCK (0)
===============================================================================
```

Interpretation
--------------

When comparing measurement results, the ***mean*** (average) execution time may seem like the most obvious choice. However, it has to be noted that the *mean* of a data sample is highly sensitive to “outliers” and therefore can be misleading! This is especially true, when there exists a lot of variation in the data sample. Consequently, comparing the ***median*** execution times often is the better choice. That is because the *median* of a data sample is much more robust against outliers.

Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that the *mean* (or *median*) execution time computed from a limited number of metering passes only yields an ***estimate*** of the program's “real” average execution time (expected value). The “real” value can only be determined accurately from an *infitinte* number of metering passes &ndash; which is **not** possible in practice. In this situation, we can have a look at the ***confidence intervals***. These intervals contain the “real” value, *with very high probability*. The most commonly used *confidence interval* is the “95%” one (higher confidence means broader interval, and vice versa).

Simply put, as long as the confidence intervals of program A and program B *overlap* (at least partially), we **must not** conclude that either of these programs runs faster (or slower) in the average case. ***No*** conclusion can be drawn in that case!
